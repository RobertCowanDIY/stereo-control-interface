# stereo-control-interface

The stereo control interface is a device that interfaces with an audio system to simplify and automate some functions.  The initial version listens for an audio signal on the analog audio inputs and sends RS232 commands to a home theater processor when music is present.  This automates the process of needing to turn on equipment when playing music from music streamers.
